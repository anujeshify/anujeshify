## Anujesh Bansal

I'm a Computer Science Engineering student who thrives on transforming challenges into creative solutions. Whether I'm decoding social trends or building tools for mental wellness, I believe in crafting technology with empathy and precision.
When I'm not coding, you'll find me writing poetry, fueling hackathons, or chasing football glory. I believe in the power of collaboration and continuous learning, and I'm always eager to connect with fellow developers and creators.
